		<p> <span>Hello,</span> my name is Chad Eddington. I am a <b>Software Engineering</b> major at BYU-Idaho. I have about
			three semesters left until I graduate. Growing up, I loved to create things. In middle school, I loved to take music and 
			art classes. In high school I played guitar in a band and was introduced to graphic design. Since then, I've learned about 
			programing. Programing has beome my outlet for creativity. I love being able to build things and have them do whatever I
			want! I also love my family. Here is a picture of my wife and firstborn son! I now have <b>two</b> sons and will
			be getting an updated picture of all of us soon.</p>
